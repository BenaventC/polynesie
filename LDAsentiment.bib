	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

	abstract = {The notion that companies must go above and beyond in their customer service activities is so entrenched that managers rarely examine it. But a study of more than 75,000 people interacting with contact-center representatives or using self-service channels found that over-the-top efforts make little difference: All customers really want is a simple, quick solution to their problem. The Corporate Executive Board's Dixon and colleagues describe five loyalty-building tactics that every company should adopt: Reduce the need for repeat calls by anticipating and dealing with related downstream issues; arm reps to address the emotional side of customer interactions; minimize the need for customers to switch service channels; elicit and use feedback from disgruntled or struggling customers; and focus on problem solving, not speed. The authors also introduce the Customer Effort Score and show that it is a better predictor of loyalty than customer satisfaction measures or the Net Promoter Score.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an integrative model of consumer complaining behavior, in which effort is posited as the critical determinant of consumer complaint voicing in first-stage CCB. It is necessary to distinguish between first-stage and latter-stage complaining because: 1. Most dissatisfied consumers still do not voice complaints despite the best efforts of practitioners who prefer to hear complaints voiced directly to them. 2. Latter-stage complainants have already identified themselves as dissatisfied by voicing complaints. 3. Their behavior tends to be responsive to recovery attempts rather than to initial dissatisfying experiences. The Effort Model (EM) suggests that anticipated effort mediates the relationship between CCR and well-known antecedents such as product importance, assertiveness, attitude toward complaining, experience, and time constraints. It is suggested that firms can increase the proportion of consumers voicing complaints by taking actions to reduce the amount of},

Cette nouvelle forme d'externalisation n'a cessé d'évoluer en s'amplifiant et en se diversifiant pour, par exemple, donner naissance au crowdfunding ou au crowdtesting. A la différence d'une externalisation classique, le crowdsourcing bénéficie de la synergie entre la foule et les technologies Internet, ce qui lui confère des potentialités immenses. Se fondant à la fois sur des approches théoriques en management et sur des exemples concrets, cet ouvrage présente en détail onze types distincts d'opérations de crowdsourcing. Il montre comment cette nouvelle externalisation peut être utilisée pour créer de la valeur et de nouvelles opportunités pour les entreprises. Pour en mesurer les effets, une analyse présente un modèle original qui lie types de valeur, types de foule, motivations et incitations. Les aspects critiques du crowdsourcing, son éthique et son avenir sont discutés avec notamment une ouverture sur les synergies potentiellement importantes entre crowdsourcing, impression 3D et monnaie virtuelle."},

However, in many applications of these models, the collection grows over time, making it infeasible to run batch algorithms repeatedly. This problem can be addressed by using online algorithms, which update estimates of the topics as each document is observed. We introduce two related Rao-Blackwellized online inference algorithms for the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model – incremental Gibbs samplers and particle filters – and compare their runtime and performance to that of existing algorithms.},

	abstract = {We show, via a massive (N = 689,003) experiment on Facebook, that emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues.Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks.

The results show that the median standard of living and the education level are the main determinants of the general participation, whereas some specific variables explain the participation of each of the four topics.},

	abstract = {Despite widespread adoption, machine learning models remain mostly black boxes. Understanding the reasons behind predictions is, however, quite important in assessing trust, which is fundamental if one plans to take action based on a prediction, or when choosing whether to deploy a new model. Such understanding also provides insights into the model, which can be used to transform an untrustworthy model or prediction into a trustworthy one. In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. We demonstrate the flexibility of these methods by explaining different models for text (e.g. random forests) and image classification (e.g. neural networks). We show the utility of explanations via novel experiments, both simulated and with human subjects, on various scenarios that require trust: deciding if one should trust a prediction, choosing between models, improving an untrustworthy classifier, and identifying why a classifier should not be trusted.},

But a study of more than 75,000 people interacting with contact-center representatives or using self-service channels found that over-the-top efforts make little difference: All customers really want is a simple, quick solution to their problem. The Corporate Executive Board's Dixon and colleagues describe five loyalty-building tactics that every company should adopt: Reduce the need for repeat calls by anticipating and dealing with related downstream issues; arm reps to address the emotional side of customer interactions; minimize the need for customers to switch service channels; elicit and use feedback from disgruntled or struggling customers; and focus on problem solving, not speed.

	abstract = {This paper introduces an integrative model of consumer complaining behavior, in which effort is posited as the critical determinant of consumer complaint voicing in first-stage CCB. It is necessary to distinguish between first-stage and latter-stage complaining because: 1. Most dissatisfied consumers still do not voice complaints despite the best efforts of practitioners who prefer to hear complaints voiced directly to them. 2. Latter-stage complainants have already identified themselves as dissatisfied by voicing complaints. 3. Their behavior tends to be responsive to recovery attempts rather than to initial dissatisfying experiences. The Effort Model (EM) suggests that anticipated effort mediates the relationship between CCR and well-known antecedents such as product importance, assertiveness, attitude toward complaining, experience, and time constraints. It is suggested that firms can increase the proportion of consumers voicing complaints by taking actions to reduce the amount of},

Cette nouvelle forme d'externalisation n'a cessé d'évoluer en s'amplifiant et en se diversifiant pour, par exemple, donner naissance au crowdfunding ou au crowdtesting. A la différence d'une externalisation classique, le crowdsourcing bénéficie de la synergie entre la foule et les technologies Internet, ce qui lui confère des potentialités immenses. Se fondant à la fois sur des approches théoriques en management et sur des exemples concrets, cet ouvrage présente en détail onze types distincts d'opérations de crowdsourcing. Il montre comment cette nouvelle externalisation peut être utilisée pour créer de la valeur et de nouvelles opportunités pour les entreprises. Pour en mesurer les effets, une analyse présente un modèle original qui lie types de valeur, types de foule, motivations et incitations. Les aspects critiques du crowdsourcing, son éthique et son avenir sont discutés avec notamment une ouverture sur les synergies potentiellement importantes entre crowdsourcing, impression 3D et monnaie virtuelle."},

	abstract = {Inference algorithms for topic models are typically designed to be run over an entire collection of documents after they have been observed. However, in many applications of these models, the collection grows over time, making it infeasible to run batch algorithms repeatedly. This problem can be addressed by using online algorithms, which update estimates of the topics as each document is observed. We introduce two related Rao-Blackwellized online inference algorithms for the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model – incremental Gibbs samplers and particle filters – and compare their runtime and performance to that of existing algorithms.},

Results from several complexity types are presented, including lexical diversity, density, readability and syntactic complexity. The language of WoW texts is found to be comparable to the general corpus on some complexity measures, yet more specialized on other measures. Our findings can be used by educators willing to include game-related activities into school curricula.},

	abstract = {We show, via a massive (N = 689,003) experiment on Facebook, that emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. We provide experimental evidence that emotional contagion occurs without direct interaction between people (exposure to a friend expressing an emotion is sufficient), and in the complete absence of nonverbal cues.Emotional states can be transferred to others via emotional contagion, leading people to experience the same emotions without their awareness. Emotional contagion is well established in laboratory experiments, with people transferring positive and negative emotions to others. Data from a large real-world social network, collected over a 20-y period suggests that longer-lasting moods (e.g., depression, happiness) can be transferred through networks [Fowler JH, Christakis NA (2008) BMJ 337:a2338], although the results are controversial. In an experiment with people who use Facebook, we test whether emotional contagion occurs outside of in-person interaction between individuals by reducing the amount of emotional content in the News Feed. When positive expressions were reduced, people produced fewer positive posts and more negative posts; when negative expressions were reduced, the opposite pattern occurred. These results indicate that emotions expressed by others on Facebook influence our own emotions, constituting experimental evidence for massive-scale contagion via social networks. This work also suggests that, in contrast to prevailing assumptions, in-person interaction and nonverbal cues are not strictly necessary for emotional contagion, and that the observation of others’ positive experiences constitutes a positive experience for people.},

We replicate 21 systematically selected experimental studies in the social sciences published in Nature and Science between 2010 and 201516–36. The replications follow analysis plans reviewed by the original authors and pre-registered prior to the replications. The replications are high powered, with sample sizes on average about five times higher than in the original studies. We find a significant effect in the same direction as the original study for 13 (62\%) studies, and the effect size of the replications is on average about 50\% of the original effect size. Replicability varies between 12 (57\%) and 14 (67\%) studies for complementary replicability indicators. Consistent with these results, the estimated true-positive rate is 67\% in a Bayesian analysis. The relative effect size of true positives is estimated to be 71\%, suggesting that both false positives and inflated effect sizes of true positives contribute to imperfect reproducibility. Furthermore, we find that peer beliefs of replicability are strongly related to replicability, suggesting that the research community could predict which results would replicate and that failures to replicate were not the result of chance alone.},

We find a significant effect in the same direction as the original study for 13 (62\%) studies, and the effect size of the replications is on average about 50\% of the original effect size. Replicability varies between 12 (57\%) and 14 (67\%) studies for complementary replicability indicators. Consistent with these results, the estimated true-positive rate is 67\% in a Bayesian analysis. The relative effect size of true positives is estimated to be 71\%, suggesting that both false positives and inflated effect sizes of true positives contribute to imperfect reproducibility. Furthermore, we find that peer beliefs of replicability are strongly related to replicability, suggesting that the research community could predict which results would replicate and that failures to replicate were not the result of chance alone.},

Second, we use an econometric approach to assess the local determinants of the general participation and the participation on each of the four topics of the "Grand débat". The results show that the median standard of living and the education level are the main determinants of the general participation, whereas some specific variables explain the participation of each of the four topics.},

Nous testons ensuite la validité interne du LSDFr en le comparant avec un corpus de textes codés manuellement.

We compare the LSDFr to the only other French sentiment lexicon, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count ( LIWC ). First, we detail the construction of the dictionary. We then test the internal validity of the LSDFr comparing it with a corpus of manually coded texts. Finally, we test the external validity of LSDFr by measuring how the media tone, calculated using our dictionary, predicts voting intentions in the last four Quebec elections.
